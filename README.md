2 things for marco 

1.i have added PSD in case since for some reason files were too big for me to open it in adobe acrobat on my laptop 
2.i have added .gitkeep inside images folder to make it show up (which it says i do have it in sublime text, but it will not show up at all in github for some odd reason)
